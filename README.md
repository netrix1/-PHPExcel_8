# PHPExcel for PHP 8.2

This is a fork of the PHPexcel project for PHP 8. It has been tested on PHP 8 and, so far, has not presented any significant errors.

## Atention
Use only if you are updating the system from a legacy version. If starting a new project, I recommend using [PHPOffice](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet).
